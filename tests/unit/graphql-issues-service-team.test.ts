/**
 * Unit tests for team resolution validation in GraphQLIssuesService
 *
 * These tests verify the fix for issue #16:
 * - `--team` filter silently matches wrong team when using key/name
 *
 * Root cause: GraphQL `or` filter with undefined variables matches anything,
 * so when teamKey or teamName is undefined, `{ eq: undefined }` matches any team.
 *
 * The fix: After batch resolve, validate that the returned team actually
 * matches the requested identifier before using it.
